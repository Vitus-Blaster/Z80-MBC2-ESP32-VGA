In this section we have a versione of BBCBasic recompiled with customized graphic (and audio) instructions for Fabglâ€™s VT100 video and ESP32 graphic terminal.
The changes I have made currently are:

MODE 0 | 1: text screen | graphic screen. The text screen is 80 columns by 24 lines and color characters. 
The graphic extension is rigid and is fixed at 640 horizontal points by 480 vertical points.

CLG: Screen cleaning in graphics mode.

GCOL R, G, B: color setting of the dot or line indicating the intensity of red, green and blue.

PLOT X, Y: lights up a colored dot in the graphic screen (see GLC).

DRAW X1, Y1, X2, Y2: draws a colored line between the coordinate pairs.

MOVE X, Y: scrolls x columns and y rows on a graphic page.

SOUND TYPE, FREQUENCY, DURATION, VOLUME: emits a sound of type 0-sine 1-square 2-triangle 3-sawtooth 4-noise 5-vic noise, 
frequency in Hertz, duration in milliseconds and volume between 0 and 127

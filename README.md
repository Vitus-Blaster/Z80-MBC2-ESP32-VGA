# Hi-tech-C-3.09
My opinion is that it is the best C compiler for CP / M-80,
an exact balance between efficiency and usability.

In the IEEE754 folder there is the description of how Hi-tech technicians
have implemented IEEE754 representation (single precision) and examples.

In the LIBC and LIBF folders you will find the sources of the modules in C and
in assembler to compile (the sources are in sources.zip).

The LIBV folder contains my implementations of modules that aren't in LIBC and LIBF.

In Parameters passing you will find the description and an example of how the compiler 
receives and returns the parameters through the index register IX.
